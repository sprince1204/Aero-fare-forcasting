# Airfare Price Forecasting System

This project predicts flight fares based on a variety of features using machine learning models. The prediction model is built with a focus on improving the accuracy of flight price forecasting, enabling airlines and customers to better anticipate fare trends.

## Features

- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns in the flight data.
- Implemented advanced feature selection techniques to optimize input data for prediction.
- Trained multiple machine learning models to accurately predict flight fares.
- Achieved improved forecast accuracy with ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about flights, including details such as:

- Airline
- Date of Journey
- Source and Destination
- Route
- Duration
- Number of stops
- Price

The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical data, and feature scaling.
